      The Rugby Centurions brings together the worldâ€™s most respected rugby
      legends who have played for their country 100 or more times. Currently
      over 55 high-profile Centurions have joined the Rugby Centurions and hail
      from Australia, France, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, South Africa, Wales
      and Scotland.


      The Rugby Centurions have established the Future Leadership Programme as
      their core platform to educate, inspire, mentor and transfer key
      leadership skills to the next generation.


      The programme is designed and developed around the values of being a
      Centurion. These values will be at the very heart of the programme where
      we will be developing leadership skills both on and off the pitch.
